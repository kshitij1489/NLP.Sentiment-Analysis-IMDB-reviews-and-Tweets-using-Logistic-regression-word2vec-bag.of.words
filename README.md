# Sentiment-Analysis---IMDB-Twitter
Sentimental Analysis on IMDB reviews and Tweets: Used Logistic regression to classify reviews on the features extracted from two models, doc2Vec and Bag of words model. Achieved an accuracy of 83% and 84% respectively.


In this project we implement 

(1) A more traditional NLP technique where the features are simply “important” words(Bag of Words model) and the feature vectors are simple binary vectors

(2) the Doc2Vec: technique where document vectors are learned via artificial neural networks
